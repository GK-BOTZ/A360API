**A360API** is an open-source, asynchronous Python API built with **FastAPI**, a modern and high-performance web framework. This project combines custom-built libraries with popular ones to deliver a powerful toolkit for developers. Currently under active development, A360API is not yet fully functional but is being crafted with passion by **Abir Arafat Chawdhury (@abirxdhack)** to provide a versatile set of tools for various applications.

> **Note**: This project is in active development. Features and endpoints are being added and refined. Stay tuned for updates via our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/TheSmartDev)!

## üåü Overview

A360API is designed to be a developer-friendly, modular API toolkit that leverages the power of **FastAPI** for asynchronous performance. Built with a combination of custom libraries (e.g., `smartfaker`, `smartbindb`) and popular ones (e.g., `requests`, `aiohttp`, `googletrans`), it aims to simplify tasks such as media downloading, data scraping, translation, and more. The project is maintained by **@abirxdhack**, a visionary coder dedicated to creating innovative solutions.

While still in development, A360API is poised to become a go-to resource for developers building bots, web applications, or other projects requiring robust API functionalities.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Asynchronous Performance**: Built with FastAPI for high-speed, non-blocking API requests.
- **Modular Architecture**: Plugins (`ccgen.py`, `fake.py`, etc.) allow easy extension and maintenance.
- **Diverse Toolset**: Supports media downloading, translation, coupon scraping, P2P trading, and more (to be implemented).
- **Open-Source**: Fully open-source with contributions welcome via GitHub.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive documentation and example requests for easy integration.
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and new features being added by @abirxdhack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To set up A360API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abirxdhack/A360API.git
   cd A360API
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the API**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The API will start at `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured host/port, e.g., `http://192.168.16.100:8000`).

5. **Access the Documentation**:
   Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the interactive API documentation.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with A360API endpoints using tools like `curl`, Postman, or your preferred HTTP client. The API is hosted at `http://192.168.16.100:8000` (update based on your deployment).

Example request to test an endpoint (once implemented):
```bash
curl -X GET "http://192.168.16.100:8000/tr?text=Hello&lang=es"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "translated_text": "Hola",
  "api_owner": "@ISmartCoder",
  "api_updates": "t.me/TheSmartDev"
}
```
